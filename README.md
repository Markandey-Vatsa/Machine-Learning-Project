Machine Learning project (Implementing EMD-BILSTM and CNN-BILSTM-MLP Models

This repository contains implementations of EMD-BILSTM and CNN-BILSTM-MLP models for advanced time-series analysis and classification tasks. These models leverage deep learning techniques to extract meaningful patterns and improve prediction accuracy.
# EMD-BILSTM: 
Combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) for signal preprocessing with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks for sequence modeling.
# CNN-BILSTM-MLP:
Integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction, BiLSTM for temporal pattern learning, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for final classification or regression.
